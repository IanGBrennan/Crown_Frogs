# Biogeography
+ *BGB_DEC_...pdf*: Plots of 12 models (6 models x 2 hypotheses) from BioGeoBEARS
+ *BGB_DEC.R*: Code for running BioGeoBEARS
+ *BGB_dispersal.csv*: time-stratified dispersal multipliers among regions (for parameter *w*). Input file for BGB is *CrownFrogs_dispersal.txt*, not this file.
+ *BGB_distances_scaled.csv*: time-stratified distance multipliers among regions. Distances between physically adjacent regions were coded as 1, and then remaining distances were corrected by the shortest distance between two areas (for parameter *x*). Input file for BGB is *CrownFrogs_distances_scaled.txt*, not this file.
+ *BGB_Legend.pdf*: Color legend of areas and combinations
+ *BGB_Results_Fossils*: model comparison results
+ *CrownFrogs_BGB_Fossils_rotated.tre*: tree rotated for presentation in Fig.3
+ *CrownFrogs_BGB_Fossils.tre*: tree used for BGB analyses
+ *CrownFrogs_BGB_H1_ForPlotting.csv*: sample distributions for plotting
+ *CrownFrogs_BGB_H1.txt / CrownFrogs_BGB_H2.txt*: sample ranges for BGB analyses under H1 & H2
+ *CrownFrogs_DEC...Rdata*: BGB model results for 12 models (6 models x 2 hypotheses)
+ *CrownFrogs_dispersal.txt*: time-stratified dispersal multipliers among regions (for parameter *w*). File for use in BGB analysis
+ *CrownFrogs_distances_scaled.txt*: time-stratified distance multipliers among regions. Distances between physically adjacent regions were coded as 1, and then remaining distances were corrected by the shortest distance between two areas (for parameter *x*). File for use in BGB analysis.
+ *CrownFrogs_RangesKey.txt*
+ *CrownFrogs_timeperiods.txt*: time-stratifications for use in BGB analysis
+ *Fossil_Tree.R*: code for building tree incorporating fossil information for BGB analysis
+ *Plot_Observed_Ranges.R*: code to plot the contemporary distributions of samples (see Fig.3)
