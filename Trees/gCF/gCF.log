Host:    IanANU.local (SSE4.2, 16 GB RAM)
Command: /Applications/iqtree-2.2.2.6-MacOSX/bin/iqtree2 -t Crown_Oz_ASTRAL.tre --gcf Crown_Oz_AllLoci2.trees --prefix gCF
Seed:    915282 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Thu Jun 15 10:19:58 2023
Kernel:  SSE2 - 1 threads (10 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 10 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.

Tree with concordance factors written to gCF.cf.tree
Annotated tree (best viewed in FigTree) written to gCF.cf.tree.nex
Tree with branch IDs written to gCF.cf.branch
Concordance factors per branch printed to gCF.cf.stat
WARNING: You probably want the --scfl option. The site concordance factor
 implemented with the --scf option is based on parsimony (described here:
 https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaa106). It has since been superseded by a more
 accurate likelihood-based approach which is implemented in the --scfl option, and
 is described in the paper "Updated site concordance factors minimize effects of
 homoplasy and taxon sampling" by Yu et al.. Please see the tutorial here for more
