# Alignments

+ *Crown_Oz_Alignments.zip*: individual locus alignments e.g.

+ *Crown_Oz_CodonAlignments.zip*: codon position alignments, e.g. input alignment for MCMCtree is *CrownFrogs_Concat_NT_12_3.phy*

+ concatenated alignment *CrownFrogs_Concat.phy*

+ partition files for locus *CrownFrogs_Concat_partitions.txt* and codon position/NT *CrownFrogs_NTpartitions.txt*

+ locus summary file generated by AMAS *CrownFrogs_Oz_summary.txt*

+ *Intermediate_Alignments.zip* and *MMHH_Alignments.zip* contain preliminary alignment files from the different AHE projects prior to combining them

+ *RBH_AHE_XenopusExons.csv*: results of the Reciprocal Blast Hits of AHE against Xenopus exons

+ *Xenopus_tropicalis_exons.txt.zip*: zipped fasta file of Xenopus exons
