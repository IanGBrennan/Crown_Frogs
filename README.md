# Crown_Frogs

## Directories  
A general guide to the directories and files contained in this repository.  

### Alignments
+ *Crown_Oz_Alignments.zip*: individual locus alignments e.g.
+ *Crown_Oz_CodonAlignments.zip*: codon position alignments, e.g. input alignment for MCMCtree is *CrownFrogs_Concat_NT_12_3.phy*
+ concatenated alignment *CrownFrogs_Concat.phy*
+ partition files for locus *CrownFrogs_Concat_partitions.txt* and codon position/NT *CrownFrogs_NTpartitions.txt*
+ locus summary file generated by AMAS *CrownFrogs_Oz_summary.txt*
+ *Intermediate_Alignments.zip* and *MMHH_Alignments.zip* contain preliminary alignment files from the different AHE projects prior to combining them

### Figures
+ Main text figures 1 & 2
+ Supplementary figures S1-5
+ Frog illustrations from main figure 2 (feel free to reuse!)
+ Fossil calibration figure from Table S2

### Manuscript
+ Cover letter, manuscript, and presubmission notes

### Scripts
+ *Alignment_Prep.R* is a scratchpad of the commands for combining the alignments from the four different AHE projects
+ *combineOrthologues.R* function for combining alignments
+ *Comparative_Radiations.R* is the script for building the figure comparing Australian radiation ages by species richness
+ *Condensing_Alignments.R* helps to generate a pseudo-reference genome for each AHE project because the AHE locus numbers differ
+ *dropEmptyTaxa.R* removes taxa with all 'N', '-', or '?' in alignments. This happens when you split up a concatenated alignment
+ *ggplotRegression.R* linear regression plotted as ggplot object
+ *Oz_Rainfall_Map.R* is the script for building the rainfall map of Australia

### Trees
+ *Crown_Oz_AllLoci.trees*: genetrees for all loci
+ *Crown_Oz_ASTRAL_Names.csv*: file of sample names
+ *Crown_Oz_ASTRAL.tre*: ASTRAL species tree built from IQTREE genetrees
+ *Crown_Oz_GeneTrees.zip*: named genetree files
+ *CrownFrogs_Calibrations.tre*: input tree for MCMCtree labelled with fossil calibrations at nodes
+ *CrownFrogs_mcmctree.tre*: MCMCtree time-calibrated tree (Fig.2)
+ *CrownFrogs_Oz_qDist20_ASTRAL.tre*: ASTRAL species tree build from IQTREE genetrees with quartet dissimilarity scores of <20 from *Crown_Oz_Astral.tre*
+ *CrownFrogs_Oz_qDist20.trees*: IQTREE genetrees of loci with quartet dissimilarity scores <20 from *Crown_Oz_Astral.tre*.
