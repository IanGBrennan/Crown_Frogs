# Australian Frogs
Documentation for *Populating a Continent: Phylogenomics Reveal the Timing of Australian Frog Diversification*  

This project focuses on the phylogenetics and timing of Australian frog diversification. If you're here, you've probably already read the paper. But, in short, we ask three basic questions:  
+ (1) Where did Australiaâ€™s frogs originate?  
+ (2) When did they get to Australia?  
+ (3) Who and where are their closest relatives?
